# CoopVM
My code for Cooperative Voter Model.
The original code was written while working on my Laurea Triennale's thesis "The Cooperative Voter Model" at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova. My supervisor was Samir Suweis.
All the code is written in Python.
There is a TODO list of features that needs to be implemented, in order to make possible to run the code in every computer with better performances and maybe someday be distributed as a Open Source module or library for Python.

OTHER NOTES:
In my_output.py I use a matplotlib style called 'seaborn', which is not the original one provided by mpl. 
The new 'seaborn' style (which you can find in \Analyser folder) has to be copied in the matplotlib stylelib, that in my computer is found at the address:
.\Anaconda3\pkgs\matplotlib-2.2.2-py36h153e9ff_1\Lib\site-packages\matplotlib\mpl-data\stylelib
