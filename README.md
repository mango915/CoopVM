# CoopVM
My code for Cooperative Voter Model.
The original code was written while working on my Laurea Triennale's thesis "The Cooperative Voter Model" at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova. My supervisor was Samir Suweis.
All the code is written in Python.
There is a TODO list of features that needs to be implemented, in order to make possible to run the code in every computer with better performances and maybe someday be distributed as a Open Source module or library for Python.
