Instructions for use:
open launch_test.py
change the work_dir (which actually is the adress at which will be created a folder where all the data from the simulation will be stored)
set the variables (or leave them as they are)
choose which commands to execute (by modifing the list commands = [...])
note that each value in commands tells the program to execute the 'if x == n:' statement, so you should choose integer values between 0 and 4
run launch_test
