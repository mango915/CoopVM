All the programs in this folder aren't really necessary to run the simulator or the analyser.
Some of them were developed to personalize certain graphic features, like 'reorder matrix', but mostly are patches used to replot some specific data from older version of the program. 
Anyway they can be seen as raw material for new branches to be developed and I'll try to describe them in their headings sections or down here.
